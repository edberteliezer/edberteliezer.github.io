      <caption webpage="index" alt="FREE WHILE-YOU-WAIT ESTIMATE Taking apart your Macbook to determine what is wrong with it costs $0 here. We believe diagnostic fees are predatory in this business. For a spoken word estimate of your problem, there is no fee! You’re here because you need fast service. If you had five days for someone to dick around guessing what is wrong with your computer, you’d fix it yourself. We get that. That’s why we offer while you wait estimates (for most things besides liquid damage.) This means we’ll tell you what is most likely wrong with your laptop before you leave. Just visit our store. This is not possible in every case. Some machines throw us for a loop, and in some situations there could be a vast variety of problems. If your device went swimming, you most likely will have to leave it for a few hours to a day – it’s not always possible to give you a precise repair price while you wait. In most cases, if you’re willing to sit &amp; chill – we’ll open the machine and tell you what’s wrong right then and there. If you are a standard retail customer, we are happy to provide a free estimate! If you are another repair business outsourcing repairs to us, you only pay if we can complete a repair you have authorized. However, if you send a device to us for an estimate, receive the estimate, and opt to not receive a repair, there is a fee of $50. We have had a large surge of other stores firing their own technicians and having us do all the work of estimates, and the abuse of this has forced us to this policy."/>
